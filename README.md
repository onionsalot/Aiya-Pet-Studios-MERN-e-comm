A GA SEI project used to demonstrate MERN infrastructure. This is a sample e-commerce site that will demonstrate the use of full CRUD on multiple mongoDb models.

My girlfriend is an independent artist who uses Etsy as her main means of pushing products. This app was inspired by that and will be a stepping point for a full site dedicated to her work.
